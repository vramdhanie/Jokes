Pull your self together.


Doctor Doctor I keep dreaming of Teepees and Wigwams

Doctor Doctor I swallowed a bone.

Doctor, doctor I keep thinking I'm a bee
Buzz off can't you see I'm busy? 


Doctor, Doctor I feel like a sheep.
That's baaaaaaaaaad!


Doctor, Doctor I think I'm suffering from Deja Vu!
Didn't I see you yesterday?

Doctor, Doctor, I've got wind! Can you give me something?
Yes – here's a kite!
